Beamer Theme HTWDD
==================

An inofficial presentation theme of the University of Applied Sciences Dresden (HTWDD).


Background
----------

This beamer theme is a custom theme, styled with simpliness in mind.
The design and first version without tikz was made by Hermann Lorenz,
which was used in many student presentations between 2012 and 2014.
Angelos Drossos decided to refactor this theme using technics
provided by tikz.


Requirements
------------

This beamer theme needs the TikZ (pgf) package to be able to compile.
The example representation is compileable with PDFLaTeX and LuaLaTeX.
